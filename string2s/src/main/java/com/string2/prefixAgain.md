# PrefixAgain
Given a string, consider the prefix string made of the 
first N chars of the string. Does that prefix string 
appear somewhere else in the string? Assume that the 
string is not empty and that N is in the 
range 1..str.length().
```
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 1) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 2) → true
prefixAgain("abXYabc", 3) → false
```
