#  xyBalance


We'll say that a String is xy-balanced if for all the 'x' chars in the string, there exists a 'y' char somewhere later in the string. So "xxy" is balanced, but "xyx" is not. One 'y' can balance multiple 'x's. Return true if the given string is xy-balanced.
```
xyBalance("aaxbby") → true
xyBalance("aaxbb") → false
xyBalance("yaaxbb") → false
```
