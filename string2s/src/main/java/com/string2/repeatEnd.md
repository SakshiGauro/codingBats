# RepeatEnd

Given a string and an int n, return a string made of n repetitions of the last n characters of the string. You may assume that n is between 0 and the length of the string, inclusive.

```
repeatEnd("Hello", 3) → "llollollo"
repeatEnd("Hello", 2) → "lolo"
repeatEnd("Hello", 1) → "o"
```
