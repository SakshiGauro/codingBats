# BigDiff

Given an array length 1 or more of ints, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array. Note: the built-in Math.min(v1, v2) and Math.max(v1, v2) methods return the smaller or larger of two values.
```
bigDiff([10, 3, 5, 6]) → 7
bigDiff([7, 2, 10, 9]) → 8
bigDiff([2, 10, 7, 2]) → 8
```
