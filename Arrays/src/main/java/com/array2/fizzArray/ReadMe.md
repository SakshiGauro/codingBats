# FizzArray
Given a number n, create and return a new int array of length n, containing the numbers 0, 1, 2, ... n-1. The given n may be 0, in which case just return a length 0 array. You do not need a separate if-statement for the length-0 case; the for-loop should naturally execute 0 times in that case, so it just works. The syntax to make a new int array is: new int[desired_length]   (See also: https://codingbat.com/doc/practice/fizzbuzz-code.html)

fizzArray(4) → [0, 1, 2, 3]
fizzArray(1) → [0]
fizzArray(10) → [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
