# FizzArray3

Given start and end numbers, return a new array containing the sequence of integers from start up to but not including end, so start=5 and end=10 yields {5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. The end number will be greater or equal to the start number. Note that a length-0 array is valid. (See also: https://codingbat.com/doc/practice/fizzbuzz-code.html)
```
fizzArray3(5, 10) → [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
fizzArray3(11, 18) → [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]
fizzArray3(1, 3) → [1, 2]
```
