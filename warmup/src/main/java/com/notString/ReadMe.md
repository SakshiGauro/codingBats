# NotString

Given a string, return a new string where "not " has been added to the front. However, if the string already begins with "not", return the string unchanged. Note: use .equals() to compare 2 strings.
```
notString("candy") → "not candy"
notString("x") → "not x"
notString("not bad") → "not bad"
```
