# Front3

Given a string, we'll say that the front is the first 3 chars of the string. If the string length is less than 3, the front is whatever is there. Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front.
```
front3("Java") → "JavJavJav"
front3("Chocolate") → "ChoChoCho"
front3("abc") → "abcabcabc"
```
