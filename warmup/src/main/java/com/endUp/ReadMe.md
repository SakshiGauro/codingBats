# EndUp

Given a string, return a new string where the last 3 chars are now in upper case. If the string has less than 3 chars, uppercase whatever is there. Note that str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string.
```
endUp("Hello") → "HeLLO"
endUp("hi there") → "hi thERE"
endUp("hi") → "HI"
```
